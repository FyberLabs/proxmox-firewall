# Global variables for all playbooks
# This file contains default configurations and templates
# Site-specific configurations are stored in separate files in this directory
# (e.g., site1.yml, site2.yml) and are created by scripts/create_site_config.sh

# Site configuration template
# Each site should have its own file (e.g., site1.yml) with this structure:
# site_config:
#   name: "site_name"          # Short machine-friendly name
#   display_name: "Site Name"  # Human-readable name
#   network_prefix: "10.1"     # Base network prefix
#   domain: "site1.local"      # Local domain name
