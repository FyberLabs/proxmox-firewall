- **Open Source**: MIT licensed with full source code availability

### What hardware do I need?

**Minimum Requirements:**
- CPU: Intel N100 or equivalent
- RAM: 8GB
- Storage: 128GB SSD
- Network: 2x 2.5GbE ports

**Recommended:**
- CPU: Intel N305 or better
- RAM: 16GB+
- Storage: 256GB+ SSD
- Network: 4x 2.5GbE + 2x 10GbE SFP+

See our [Hardware Guide](../setup/HARDWARE.md) for detailed specifications.

## üîß Installation and Setup

### Can I test this without physical hardware?

Yes! We provide a comprehensive Docker test environment:

```bash
cd docker-test-framework
./run-integration-tests.sh -t example
```

This simulates the entire deployment without requiring physical hardware.

### How long does deployment take?

- **Docker test environment**: 10-15 minutes
- **Production deployment**: 30-60 minutes
- **Multi-site setup**: 1-2 hours per additional site

### Do I need to know Ansible/Terraform?

Not for basic usage. The project provides:
- Simple configuration scripts
- YAML-based site configuration
- Automated validation
- Comprehensive documentation

However, Ansible/Terraform knowledge helps for customization.

### What operating systems are supported?

**Control Machine (where you run the deployment):**
- Ubuntu 20.04+
- Debian 11+
- Other Linux distributions (with manual dependency installation)

**Target Hardware:**
- Proxmox VE (automatically installed via custom ISO)

## üåê Network Configuration

### How do I plan my network layout?

1. **Choose unique network prefixes** for each site (e.g., 10.1.x.x, 10.2.x.x)
2. **Plan VLAN structure**:
   - VLAN 10: Main LAN
   - VLAN 20: Cameras
   - VLAN 30: IoT devices
   - VLAN 40: Guest network
   - VLAN 50: Management

3. **Use our network planning guide**: [Network Configuration](../../config/NETWORK_PREFIX_FORMAT.md)

### Can I customize the VLAN layout?

Yes! Edit your site configuration file:

```yaml
site:
  hardware:
    network:
      vlans:
        - id: 10
          name: "main"
          subnet: "10.1.10.0/24"
        - id: 25
          name: "servers"  # Custom VLAN
          subnet: "10.1.25.0/24"
```

### How does multi-site connectivity work?

Sites connect via Tailscale mesh VPN:
- Each site advertises its subnet (e.g., 10.1.0.0/16)
- Automatic routing between sites
- Encrypted traffic over internet
- Zero-trust security model

## üîê Security

### How secure is this solution?

Very secure, with multiple layers:
- **Firewall**: Default-deny policy with explicit rules
- **IDS/IPS**: Real-time threat detection (Suricata)
- **Network Monitoring**: Deep packet inspection (Zeek)
- **VPN**: Encrypted site-to-site communication
- **Access Control**: SSH key authentication, API tokens

### Can I access services remotely?

Yes, via Tailscale VPN:
- Install Tailscale on your devices
- Access services via their Tailscale IPs
- No need to expose services to the internet
- Works from anywhere with internet

### What about compliance requirements?

The project follows industry standards:
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- CIS Controls
- OWASP security principles
- Comprehensive audit logging

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### My deployment failed, what should I do?

1. **Check the validation script**: `./validate-config.sh`
2. **Review logs**: Look for error messages in Ansible output
3. **Verify connectivity**: Ensure SSH access to Proxmox host
4. **Check our troubleshooting guide**: [Troubleshooting](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

### How do I get support?

1. **Documentation**: Check our comprehensive [docs](../README.md)
2. **GitHub Issues**: For bugs and feature requests
3. **GitHub Discussions**: For questions and community help
4. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions

### VMs won't start, what's wrong?

Common causes:
- Insufficient storage space
- Missing VM templates
- Network configuration issues
- Resource allocation problems

See [VM Troubleshooting](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md#vm-deployment-issues) for detailed solutions.

## üîå Integration and Automation
